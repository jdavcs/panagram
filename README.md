Please note: installation instructions and pre-processing scripts are a work in progress. 

# Installation

```
> git clone --recursive https://github.com/kjenike/panagram.git
> cd panagram
> pip install .
```

Panagram relies on [KMC](https://github.com/refresh-bio/KMC) to build its kmer index. This should be installed automatically, however it is possible that the KMC installation will fail but panagram will successfully install. In this case `panagram view` can be run, but `panagram index` will return an error. You may be able to debug the KMC installation by running `make -C KMC py_kmc_api` and attempting to fix any errors, then re-run `pip install -v .` after the errors are fixed.

# Running
Panagram runs in two steps, the pre-processing step (index command) and the viewing (view command). 

# Preprocessing
Usage:
Anchor KMC bitvectors to reference FASTA files to create pan-kmer bitmap
```
usage: panagram index [-h] <config.toml>
```
See example config.toml file for more details on the layout. Must include paths to all of the fasta files and optionally any annotations in gff format. 

# View

Usage:
  Display panagram viewer
```
usage: panagram view [-h] <index_dir/> [genome] [chrom] [start] [end]
  index_dir           Panagram index directory
  genome              Initial anchor genome (optional) 
  chrom               Initial chromosome (optional) 
  start               Initial start coordinate (optional) 
  end                 Initial end coordinate (optional)
  --ndebug            Run server in production mode (important for a public-
                      facing server)
  --port str          Server port (default: 8050)
  --host str          Server address (default: 127.0.0.1)
  --url_base str      A local URL prefix to use app-wide (passed to
                      Dash.dash(url_base_pathname=...)) (default: /)
  --bookmarks str     Bed file with bookmarked regions (default: None)

```

Runs a local Dash server. Browser can be viewed at http://127.0.0.1:8050/ by default.

# Bitdump

Usage:
```
usage: panagram bitdump [-h] [-v bool] index_dir coords step
  Query pan-kmer bitmap generated by "panagram index"/

  index_dir             Panagram index directory
  coords                Coordinates to query in chr:start-end format
  step                  Spacing between output kmers (optimized for multiples
                        of 100) (default: 1)
  -v bool, --verbose bool
                        Output the full bitmap (default: False)
```

# Example run

First download the example_data.zip bacterial data from: 
[http://data.schatz-lab.org/panagram/](http://data.schatz-lab.org/panagram/)

[Direct link](https://bx.bio.jhu.edu/data/panagram/example_data.zip)

Unzip the archive and you will find 5 bacterial genomes plus their annotations
```
unzip example_data.zip
```

To run, first index the genomes:

```
cd example_data
panagram index conf.toml
```

Then you can panagram to visualize (from the example_data directory):
```
panagram view . 
```

From there, you can view the results in your webbrowser at [http://127.0.0.1:8050/](http://127.0.0.1:8050)


# Hosting and Proxies

Panagram uses [Dash](https://dash.plotly.com/introduction) to serve the plotly visualizations. 
By default the dedicated webserver runs on localhost (127.0.0.1) on port 8050, but you can reverse proxy to a different port and path using a web engine 
such as [nginx](https://www.nginx.com/)

For nginx, first reconfigure your nginx configuration file to add (note to be very careful 
with the use of the slash ('/') character):

```
    location /panagram {
      proxy_pass http://127.0.0.1:8050;
    }
```

The retart nginx with 

```
systemctl stop nginx
systemctl start nginx
```

For a secure public-facing server, be sure to run with the option `panagram view --ndebug` to disable debug mode. 

You may also wish to change the base URL path with the `--url_base` option, for example to something like `--url_base /panagram/`. The port and host name can be specified by the `--port` and `--host` options.

Finally you will need to run panagram using `panagram view <dir>`. You will probably want to run this in a loop
in case it needs to be restarted, such as:

```
until panagram view --ndebug .; do echo "restarting"; sleep 1; done
```

We will optimize this process in future releases.
